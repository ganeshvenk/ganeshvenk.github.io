### The Kodavas-Kalash Connection: GV Hypothesis

<p style="text-align: justify">The origins, history and ancestry of Kodavas- a mountain tribe in the present state of
Karnataka, South India, has been an intriguing puzzle, with various theories and
hypothesis floating.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">There is a tribe called Kalash in the Chitral region of Kybher-pakhtunkhwa province of
Pakistan. They are from the dardic family of Indo-Aryans. The Kalash are considered to
be pakistan’s smallest ethno-religious groups practicing a religion classified as an ancient
form of Hinduism. They are considered unique among the people of Pakistan. The
related ethnic groups are Nuristanis and other Indo-Aryan peoples. The Kalash are
considered to be indigenous people of Asia, with their ancestors migrating to Chitral
valley from a location which was possibly further south, which the kalash call ‘Tsiyam’ in
their Folk songs. The languages spoken by these people are kalash, chitrali and urdu. The
Kalash are migrants or refugees, and they are also considered to be descendants of
Gandharis. The Kalash have maintained their own unique customs and traditions. The
culture and traditions of Kalash is stunningly unique, in comparison with the
contemporary Islamic traditions and practices surrounding them in the chitral valley. The
kalash have aggressively preserved these traditions. They are polytheists and nature
plays a highly significant and spiritual role in their daily lives. The kalash tribals offer
sacrifices and hold festivals to thank nature for the abundant resources of the three
valleys (Kalasha Desh). The Kalasha mythology and folklore though have been compared
to ancient Greece, has been found closer to Hindu traditions of the Indian sub-continent.
The Kalash are basically mountain people, celebrating three main festivals- one in may
(chilam joshi), another in autumn (Uchau), and another (caumus) in mid-winter. The
most important Kalash festival is the Chowmos ( caumus), which is celebrated during
December (chaturmasya), which marks the end of the year’s field work and harvest. The
main Chowmus ritual takes place at a Tok tree, which is denoted as Indra’s place-
‘Indrunkot’ or ‘Indreyin’. Horses, goats, cows and sheep were sacrificed. The traditional
Kalash religious practices is considered to display traits of myths, ritual, society which
echoes many aspects of Rig-vedic religion, including pre-vedic practices and beliefs,
regarded as a form of ancient Hinduism. Mahandeo is a deity to whom the Kalash pray
to (Mahadev, as is known in another parts of the Indian sub-continent). The creator
deity Imra (Yama Rajan) is called Dezau (Dezaw) whose name is derived from Indo-
European dheigh. Dezauhe is also referred to by the Pashto term Khodai. Tsyam is
considered as the mythological homeland of the Kalash. Crows represent the ancestors,
and the Kalash feed them by their left hand, as in Vedic practice. The dead are buried
above ground in ornamented wooden coffins. The Kalashi traditional music includes
flute-like instruments (high-pitch), singing, poetry, clapping, and also the rhythmic
playing of drums- Wac ( a small hourglass drum) and Dau ( a large drum played with the
smaller drum Wac).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Genetic Origins of the Kalash</strong> : West Eurasian origins have been genetically detected in a
study on the kalash. The Kalash are also detected to have distinct aboriginal links with
only minor contributions from outside people. Another study showed them to be
clustered with central/ south Asian populations. Interestingly, another study found no
evidence of their descent from soldiers of Alexander. A further study revealed the Kalash
are part of the South Asian genetic continuum with no Macedonian ethnic admixture
albeit shifted towards the Iranian people.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Historically, the Kalash are stated to be an indigenous people of Asia, with their
ancestors migrating to Afghanistan from a distant place in South Asia, which the kalash
call ‘Tsiyam’ in their folk songs and epics. Kalashi traditions record severe persecution
and massacres in the hands of Rais dynasty’s Shah Nader Rais between 1720 to 1747,
after which the Kalash had to flee the Chitral valley, and those who remained still
practising their faith had to pay tribute in kind or with Corvee labour.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The Kodavas are an exclusive ethnic mountain people, practising an exclusive form of
religion and traditions which can be strongly linked to a kind of <em>ancient Hinduist practice</em>.
Among the various theories floating about the history and racial origins of the Kodavas,
the theory of descent from Alexander’s battalion is so far the strongest.</p>
